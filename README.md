# Peter Knoepfler's dot files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.

## Installation

```bash
git clone git://github.com/knopfi/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
rake install
```

Vim plugins are managed through vundle. You'll need to install vundle to 
get them.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```
Run :PluginInstall in vim.
